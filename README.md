The purpose of this startup project is to get you going with jbehave, an elegant Java based BDD framework. 
I missed a simple example of jbehave, so here is my effort.<br/>

The project contains eclipse project file so that you can start. The required jars are already added in the lib.<br/>
Add the jars in the lib from the IDE that you use.<br/>
And then run StackStory as a unit test.
